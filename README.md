KTS
===

KTS is an HTTP API that abstracts out the complexity of Kaltura's own API
 when dealing with common use cases such as getting an embeddable player for
 an entry id, getting metadata for a given entry id, CRUD for thumbnails and 
 captions, and a few more things.


## Quickstart #

**Coming soon**


## Acknowledgments #
Thanks to the following people for a ton of help with this, otherwise KTS 
 wouldn't even have existed.
