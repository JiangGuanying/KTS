Yup, modifying the above two files to point to the remote db works!!!
The only catch is, I had to mount some_network_location:/opt/kaltura5/web to
/opt/kaltura5/web despite the local kaltura being in /opt/kaltura/

This is because the path of the file is stored in the db too. 

And I DID know this.

I simply didn't notice that the kaltura on kal0 was running from /opt/kaltura5,
and NOT from /opt/kaltura 

Need to test all other operations too though.

KMC still not loading.
